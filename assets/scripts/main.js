  // websites to have some (if not all) functionality offline! I highly
  // recommend reading up on ServiceWorkers on MDN before continuing.

  // Steps B3-B6 will be *inside* the event listener's function created in B2
  // B3. TODO - Register './sw.js' as a service worker (The MDN article
  //            "Using Service Workers" will help you here)
  // B4. TODO - Once the service worker has been successfully registered, console
  //            log that it was successful.
  // B5. TODO - In the event that the service worker registration fails, console
  //            log that it has failed.
